# BTHome Vibration Sensor

This advertises battery level, temperature, and whether the Puck is moving or not in a [BTHome (https://bthome.io/)](https://bthome.io/) compatible format, which can then be used in https://www.home-assistant.io/

This is based on https://www.espruino.com/BTHome and https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js#accelerometer-gyro

The code is available on https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+Vibration+Sensor

## Usage

Install the app and disconnect, then attach the Puck.js running this code onto something that can move (such as a washing machine).

The current battery level, temperature, and whether the Puck is moving or not will then be sent to Home Assistant.
